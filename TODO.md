 * ~~finish tests for compose~~
 * ~~own project~~
 * ~~separate test and object~~
 * ~~better matchers in modifyF test~~
 * better factor tests
 * PBTs (for laws, at least)
 * modifyF for other functors (Future?, Optional)
 * abstract over other functors
 *
 *
 * read about haskell lens - do the test examples in Haskell
 *
 * example in exchange code
 * boiler-plateyness of real examples?
