 Todo
 ------
 * ~~finish tests for compose~~
 * ~~own project~~
 * ~~separate test and object~~
 * ~~better matchers in modifyFList test~~
 * ~~better factor tests~~
 * PBTs (for Lens laws, at least)
 * ~~modifyFList for other functors (Future?, Optional)~~
 * ~~abstract over other functors~~
 * functor laws and PBTs thereto
 
 * read about haskell lens - do the test examples in Haskell
 
 * package sources
 
 * example in exchange code - AuctionDecider
 * examples of replacing 
    - builder pattern  - DecisionableResource
    - chains of getters - AuctionDecider
    ideally we use same optics for both
 
 * boiler-plateyness of real examples?
 * auto generation of lenses for data types
 
 * example using unruly.control Functor
 
 * other optics!  prisms!
 * ~~Optional^WShutter~~
 * ~~Do Optional excercises~~
 * ~~Do prism exercises~~
 
 * bug in modifyFFuture
 

 Notes
 -----
  * the types wrote the code: e.g. compose.modify(f)
