 Todo
 ------
 * ~~finish tests for compose~~
 * ~~own project~~
 * ~~separate test and object~~
 * ~~better matchers in modifyFList test~~
 * ~~better factor tests~~
 * PBTs (for Lens laws, at least)
 * ~~modifyFList for other functors (Future?, Optional)~~
 * abstract over other functors
 * functor laws and PBTs thereto
 *
 * read about haskell lens - do the test examples in Haskell
 *
 * example in exchange code
 * example using unruly.control Functor
 * boiler-plateyness of real examples?
 *
 * auto generation of lenses for data types
 *

 Notes
 -----
  * the types wrote the code: e.g. compose.modify(f)
